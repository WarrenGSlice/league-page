    <div class="subBlock">
        <p>If any owners are suspected of accepting bribes/offering bribes to enhance their/another owners team via trade, trading any assets other than fantasy players, draft picks, FAAB $, or otherwise found guilty of engaging in any form of collusion*, all parties involved in the trade will be susceptible to punishment. The punishments will go as followed:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>First Offense – Immediate reduction of FAAB budget by 80%</li>
            <li>Second Offense – Immediate freeze on all transaction types for the next 18 weeks of regular season and playoff fantasy football games, including trades and waiver wire bids</li>
            <li>Third Offense – A league meeting of all members not involved in any of the improper trades/activity in question will take place to discuss next steps.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All trades that are found guilty of collusion, will be reversed/denied. If the trade had affected the outcome of previous games, the results of those games will be revised.  </p>

        <p>Veto power only exists for the commish, but the commish as a rule will veto no trades unless there is an extreme circumstance. We are all adults and have the capacity to evaluate what is best for our respective teams.</p>

        <p>The commissioner will err on the side of letting owners manage their teams the way they see fit. Any collusion will need to be clear. The commissioner reserves the right to step in and at the very least ask both owners of a trade if they really meant to do a heavily lop-sided trade. If one owner says it was an accident, the trade shall be reversed. </p>

The team with the least season-long (including playoff weeks) best ball points for will be assigned the 1.01. The second least points will be 1.02 and so on up to pick 1.06. The commish will track and report weekly progress of best ball points for in the league chat weekly and track the progress using an excel spreadsheet.</p>

    <h3 bind:this={twoTwo}>2.2 Rookie Drafts</h3>
    <p>Rookie drafts will consist of 4 rounds of drafting, with 24 hours alotted for each pick with 8 hours of pause between mid-night and 8am. To make room for the incoming players, the league will yearly vote on roster spot additions or subtractions. These spots will be adjusted after each rookie draft, at which point you will need to have cut the necessary players.</p>
    <p>Any spots not filled during the draft, can be filled immediately afterwards from the waiver wire.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={twoThree}>2.3 Draft Day Trades</h3>

    <h3 bind:this={threeOne}>3.1 Scoring System</h3>
    <p>The league scoring system breakdown is listed on the Sleeper fantasy app (for the most part, it follows typical 1.0PPR Scoring). The scoring system will never change without a majority league vote. (Minor adjustment may be changed at the commish's dicression, with or without announcement to the league.)</p>

    </ol>

    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={five}>Section 5 Tanking Policy</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={fiveOne}>5.1 League Tanking Policy</h3>
    <p>No team may intentionally leave starting roster spots empty. Any evidence of intentionally leaving roster spots empty will result in the commish telling the manager to fix it and if not fixed, the commish will put in a player for them. Managers may play players of any status (IR, OUT, NA, D, DNR, ect). It doesn't matter as long as a player is played.</p>
    <p>In addition to these policies, 2024 marks the first year best ball points for will be used for draft-pick positioning with the intent of preventing strong teams from tanking to get the top picks. The only way for good teams to aquire top picks are to trade for them.</p>

    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={six}>Section 6 Replacing Managers</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sixOne}>6.1 Removing Managers</h3>
    <p>Short of continuously confirmed collusion, no manager can be removed against their will while being paid up on dues. Participation, through the league chat, trade offers, and the waiver wire, is strongly encouraged but generally grounds for removal. If a manager does not pay their dues by the start of the rookie draft, they will be removed and replaced.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sixTwo}>6.2 Replacing Managers</h3>
    <p>When a manager needs to be replaced, the commisiooners will try to find a suitable candidate with some connection to at least a portion of the existing managers. Priority will be placed on managers who are eager to take on a dynasty commitment and will be very active within the league.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sixThree}>6.3 Replacement Incentive</h3>
    <p>In the event that a manager chooses to quit the league or is removed by a comissioner and has a very bad roster, an incoming manager is offered a 50% reductioon on their first year buy-in. If the team being taken over has a strong roster, no price reduction will be offered. The difference will be covered by the commish. What a nice guy huh.</p>

    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={seven}>Section 7 League Finances</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sevenOne}>7.1 League Dues</h3>
    <p>League dues are set at {dues}$. Dues are collected through CashApp, Venmo, or Paypal only and stored in a secure account only touched for payouts. All managers must be fully paid up before the start of the rookie draft. In the event that a manager fails to pay before the deadline, the manager will be removed unless there is a trust-worthy agreement in place with a trusted manager. Trusted manager status is given to any manager that has paid with no problems for at least 3 straight years. Non-trusted managers will be given no quarter (been burned too many times)</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sevenTwo}>7.2 Payout</h3>
    <p>League payout is structured as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1st place: {dues * 7}$</li>
        <li>2nd place: {dues * 3}$</li>
        <li>3rd place: {dues * 2}$</li>
        <li>4th place: {dues}$</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the event that a manager was fined due to late payment, their extra fee will be added to the winner's payout. Similarly, if new managers come into the league and the payout is smaller, the difference will come out of the winner's prize.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sevenThree}>7.3 Raising Dues</h3>
    <p>A ⅔ majority vote is required in order to raise league dues and must be approved by the commish with the consideration that all managers could actually afford an increase. In the event that a manager is no longer financially comfortable with the buyin, finding a co-manager to split the cost is reccomended.</p>
